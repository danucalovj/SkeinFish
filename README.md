# SkeinFish

SkeinFish is an implementation of Skein and Threefish, with a focus on speed and completeness.
Skein is a general purpose hash algorithm and Threefish is a general purpose block cipher.
Both were designed by Bruce Schneier, among others. This is an implementation of both algorithms in C#. 

## Quick and Dirty usage guide

First, add a reference to SkeinFish.dll to your project. Next, use as such:

    using SkeinFish;
    
    static byte[] hash_skein(byte[] input)
    {
        // (state_size, output_size)
        Skein skein = new Skein(512, 512);
        return skein.ComputeHash(input, 0, input.Length);
    }

## Using Threefish

The Threefish block cipher is also implemented as part of SkeinFish (hence the name).
To use it, simply instantiate a Threefish object and use it as you would any other cipher in the .NET library.
It supports all encryption modes except CTS. All padding modes are supported.
